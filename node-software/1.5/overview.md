# Node software

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes that run the same node software. This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle, allows them to validate transactions, and allows them to store transactions in their local ledgers.**

# Fullnodes

-------------------------

## [HORNET](root://node-software/1.5/fullnodes/hornet/overview.md)
HORNET is a powerful, community driven IOTA fullnode software written in Go. It is easy to install and also runs on low-end devices.

![Bee](images/Bee.png)
## [Bee](root://node-software/1.5/fullnodes/bee/overview.md)
Bee is the node software developed in Rust and lead by the IOTA Foundation. Bee's modular approach brings a lot of possibilities, so it's not just a Node Software, Bee is a framework for building IOTA nodes, clients, and applications in Rust.

## [Chronicle](root://chronicle/1.1/overview.md)
Chronicle is an addition to the Hornet node software that allows you to store all transactions in a separate distributed database that's secure and scalable.

# Smart Contract Nodes

-------------------------
![Wasp](images/WASP_logo_dark.png)
## [Wasp](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp)
Wasp is a node software developed by the IOTA Foundation to run the IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP in short) on top of the IOTA Tangle.

# Prototype Nodes

-------------------------
![GoShimmer](images/GoShimmer.png)
## [GoShimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/wiki)
GoShimmer implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development and is documented on a GitHub wiki.
-------------------------

# Deprecated

-------------------------
![IRI](images/IRI.png)
## [IRI](root://iri/1.0/overview.md)
IRI was the original IOTA reference implementation for the IOTA Mainnet. This software is now **deprecated**. See Hornet for an up-to-date node software.
