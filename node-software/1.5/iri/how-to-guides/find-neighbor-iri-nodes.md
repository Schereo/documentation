# Find neighbors

**To synchronize the transactions in their ledgers with the rest of the network, nodes must communicate with their neighbors. To find neighbors on the same network, you must ask the owners for the URL or IP address of their IRI nodes and give them yours.**

1. Go to the #nodesharing channel on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org)

2. Ask for the URL or IP address of someone's node, and give that person the URL or IP address of your node. We recommend connecting to between 6 and 7 neighbors.

    :::info:
    Make sure these neighbors are running on the same IOTA network as the one you want to join.

3. Add the URLs or IP addresses of your neighbor IRI nodes to the [`NEIGHBORS`](../references/iri-configuration-options.md#neighbors) configuration option
