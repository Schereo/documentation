# Run IRI

**In this tutorial, you install and run the IRI node software, which turns your device into a node on an IOTA network.**

:::warning:
This software is now in maintenance mode. Only critical fixes will be made. We recommend using [Hornet](root://hornet/1.1/overview.md).

If you already have an IRI node, see [Migrating from IRI to Hornet](root://hornet/1.1/guides/migrating-from-iri.md).
:::

You have two options for running IRI:

- Run IRI in a Docker container (for Linux, macOS, and Windows)
- Build and run IRI on a Linux Ubuntu server

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- 4GB RAM
- 64-bit processor
- A [public IP address](root://general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device.md) that's either static or connected to a dynamic DNS service such as [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org)
- Ports 15600 and 14265 must be open. One way of opening ports is by [forwarding them](root://general/0.1/how-to-guides/expose-your-local-device.md) to the device that's running the IOTA node.

## Run IRI in a Docker container

In this tutorial, you download the IRI Docker image and run it in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms).

:::info:
If you're using a Debian-based operating system, add `sudo` before the commands in the following tasks.
:::

### Run IRI

To run IRI, you download and run the [IRI Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/iri).
    
1\. [Plan how you want to configure IRI](../how-to-guides/configure-iri.md)

2\. [Find some neighbors](../how-to-guides/find-neighbor-iri-nodes.md) that are running on your chosen IOTA network and make a note of their URLs or IP addresses

3\. Make a directory on your host system in which to save the IRI files

4\. Create a `config.ini` file in that directory, and add your configuration options to it

These are some example configurations:

--------------------
### Mainnet

This file configures IRI to run on the Mainnet, exposes the API on port 14265, and keeps all transactions in the database.

```bash
[IRI]
PORT = 14265
NEIGHBORING_SOCKET_PORT = 15600
NEIGHBORS = 
IXI_DIR = ixi
DEBUG = false
DB_PATH = mainnetdb
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED = false
MWM = 14
```
---

### Devnet

This file configures IRI to run in the Devnet, exposes the API on port 14265, and does local snapshots.

These neighbors have autopeering enabled, so they will automatically add you as a neighbor.

```shell
[IRI]
PORT = 14265
TESTNET = true
NEIGHBORING_SOCKET_PORT = 15600
NEIGHBORS = tcp://p101.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p102.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p103.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p104.testnet.iota.cafe:14666
IXI_DIR = ixi
DEBUG = false
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED = true
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED = true
```
--------------------

5\. Download the IRI Docker image and run it. Replace the `$PATH_TO_DIRECTORY` placeholder with the path to the directory where you saved the configuration file.

```bash
docker run --name iri --net=host -v $PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/config.ini:/path/to/conf/config.ini iotaledger/iri:latest -c /path/to/conf/config.ini
```

This command mounts the configuration file to the `path/to/conf` folder on the Docker container. You can change this path to mount the configuration file to a different folder.

:::info:
To have the IRI Docker container restart on every reboot, add the `--restart=always` flag to the `docker run` command.
:::

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
IRI is running in the background! Now, you can use the IRI API to start interacting with the Tangle.
:::

6\. Call the [getNodeInfo](../references/api-reference.md#getnodeinfo) endpoint to request general information about the IRI node

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:14265 -X POST -H 'X-IOTA-API-Version: 1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"command": "getNodeInfo"}' | jq
    ```

    You should see something like the following in the output:

    ```json
    {
    "appName": "IRI",
    "appVersion": "1.7.0-RELEASE",
    "jreAvailableProcessors": 8,
    "jreFreeMemory": 2115085674,
    "jreVersion": "1.8.0_191",
    "jreMaxMemory": 20997734400,
    "jreTotalMemory": 4860129502,
    "latestMilestone": "CUOENIPTRCNECMVOXSWKOONGZJICAPH9FIG9F9KYXF9VYXFUKTNDCCLLWRZNUHZIGLJZFWPOVCIZA9999",
    "latestMilestoneIndex": 1050373,
    "latestSolidSubtangleMilestone": "CUOENIPTRCNECMVOXSWKOONGZJICAPH9FIG9F9KYXF9VYXFUKTNDCCLLWRZNUHZIGLJZFWPOVCIZA9999",
    "latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex": 1050373,
    "milestoneStartIndex": 1039138,
    "lastSnapshottedMilestoneIndex": 1039138,
    "neighbors":6,
    "packetsQueueSize":0,
    "time":1548407444641,
    "tips":0,
    "transactionsToRequest":0,
    "features":["snapshotPruning","dnsRefresher","tipSolidification"],
    "coordinatorAddress": "EQSAUZXULTTYZCLNJNTXQTQHOMOFZERHTCGTXOLTVAHKSA9OGAZDEKECURBRIXIJWNPFCQIOVFVVXJVD9",
    "dbSizeInBytes": 144800000,
    "duration": 0
    }
    ```

Now that your node is up and running, it'll start to synchronize its ledger with the network. Give your node some time to synchronize. See [Check that the IOTA node is synchronized](#step-5-check-that-the-node-is-synchronized).

## Install and run IRI on a Linux Ubuntu server

In this tutorial, you install and run IRI as a service on a Linux device. This guide has been tested on [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04).
    
### Step 1. Download the IRI Java file

The IRI is Java software, so it must be run in a Java runtime environment (JRE).

You have two options for downloading the latest IRI software:
- Download the pre-built Java file from GitHub (quickest option)
- Build the Java file from the source code on GitHub 

#### Download the pre-built IRI Java file

The pre-built IRI Java file is available in the [IOTA GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases). Downloading this file is the quickest and simplest way to install the IRI.

1. Install the latest security patches for your system

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    ```

2. Make a directory in which to download the IRI Java file. Replace `jake` with your username.

    ```bash
    mkdir /home/jake/node
    ```
    :::info:
    If you see 'mkdir: cannot create directory...' in the output, you may have copied and pasted the command without changing `jake` to your Linux username.
    :::

3. Download and install the Java 8 OpenJDK

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common --no-install-recommends
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

    :::info:
    To check that Java is installed, enter `java -version` in the command line. You should see a version number in the output.
    :::


4. In your `node` directory, download the latest IRI Java file. Replace `jake` with your username and replace the `${VERSION}` variable with the [latest version](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases) of the IRI. 

    ```bash
    cd node
    sudo wget -O /home/jake/node/iri-${VERSION}.jar https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases/download/v${VERSION}/iri-${VERSION}.jar
    ```

    :::info:
    Make sure that you include the whole version, for example 1.8.6-RELEASE.
    :::

The download may take some time. If everything went well, you should see something like the following in the output:

```
HTTP request sent, awaiting response ... 200 OK
'/home/jake/node/iri-1.8.6-RELEASE.jar' saved [175441686/175441686]
```

Now you can [configure IRI](#configure-the-iri).

#### Build the IRI Java file from source

Instead of downloading the pre-built IRI Java file, you may want to build the file from the source code for any of the following reasons:

- You want to be sure that the code you run is the same as the source code
- You want to modify the code before you run it

1. Download and install the Java 8 OpenJDK

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common --no-install-recommends
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) build tool

    ```bash
    sudo apt install maven
    ```

3. Install Git

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git
    ```

4. Clone and check out the GitHub repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iri.git
    cd iri

    # Checkout the latest tag

    export TAG=$(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
    git checkout ${TAG}
    ```

5. Build the IRI Java file

    ```bash
    /usr/share/maven/bin/mvn clean package
    ```
    :::info:
    The IRI Java file is in a directory called `target`.
    :::

Now you can configure IRI. 

### Step 2. Configure IRI

IRI runs in a Java virtual machine, which you can optimize by setting some Java variables.

1\. Define the Java variables to optimize the Java virtual machine

```bash
export JAVA_OPTIONS="-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=60 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=75 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=10000 -XX:+UseG1GC"
export JAVA_MIN_MEMORY=2G
export JAVA_MAX_MEMORY=4G
```

**JAVA_OPTIONS:** Commands that optimize the Java virtual machine

**JAVA_MIN_MEMORY:** The initial memory allocation for the Java virtual machine

**JAVA_MAX_MEMORY:** the maximum memory allocation for the Java virtual machine

2\. [Plan how you want to configure IRI](../how-to-guides/configure-iri.md)

3\. [Find some neighbors](../how-to-guides/find-neighbor-iri-nodes.md) that are running on your chosen IOTA network and make a note of their URL or IP addresses

4\. Create a configuration file in the same directory as your IRI Java file, and add your configuration options to it. Replace `jake` with your Linux username.

```bash
nano /home/jake/node/config.ini
```

These are some example configurations:

--------------------
### Mainnet

This file configures IRI to run on the Mainnet, exposes the API on port 14265, and keeps all transactions in the database.

```bash
[IRI]
PORT = 14265
NEIGHBORING_SOCKET_PORT = 15600
NEIGHBORS = 
IXI_DIR = ixi
DEBUG = false
DB_PATH = mainnetdb
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED = false
MWM = 14
```
---

### Devnet

This command configures IRI to be compatible with the Devnet, exposes its API on port 14265, and does local snapshots.

These neighbors have autopeering enabled, so they will automatically add you as a neighbor.

```shell
[IRI]
PORT = 14265
TESTNET = true
NEIGHBORING_SOCKET_PORT = 15600
NEIGHBORS = tcp://p101.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p102.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p103.testnet.iota.cafe:14666 tcp://p104.testnet.iota.cafe:14666
IXI_DIR = ixi
DEBUG = false
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED = true
LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED = true
```
--------------------

5\. Download the latest spent addresses file and snapshot files, which contains the latest data for the Devnet and Mainnet IOTA networks. This directory is available on [the IOTA Foundation's website](https://dbfiles.iota.org/?prefix=mainnet/iri/local-snapshots-and-spent-addresses/)

:::info:
Make sure you download the correct directory for your chosen IOTA network.
:::

6\. Extract the directories in the same directory as your IRI Java file. Replace `jake` with your Linux username, and replace the `$FILE_NAME` placeholder with the name of the file you downloaded.

```bash
tar -xzvf /home/jake/node/$FILE_NAME
```
    
### Step 3. Run IRI

When you've downloaded, and configured IRI, it's time to run it.

1. Run IRI. Replace `jake` with your Linux username, and replace the `$VERSION` placeholder with the version of the IRI that you downloaded.

    ```bash
    java ${JAVA_OPTIONS} -Xms${JAVA_MIN_MEMORY} -Xmx${JAVA_MAX_MEMORY} -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar /home/jake/node/iri-${VERSION}.jar -c /home/jake/node/config.ini
    ```

    The IRI should start to log its activity in the console.

    :::info:
    We recommend making regular backups of your database files. This way, you can restore your node in case of a corrupted database or another type of node malfunction. To do so, you can create a cron job that copies the database to a different volume every day.
    :::

    :::success:Congratulations :tada:
    You're now running an IRI node!
    :::

2. Open a new terminal window on your Linux server and install Curl and JQ. Curl is used to send REST API requests to your IRI node. JQ is a command-line processor that displays JSON data in an easy-to-read format.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl jq
    ```

3. Call the [`getNodeInfo`](../references/api-reference.md#getNodeInfo) API endpoint to request general information about the IRI node

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:14265 -X POST -H 'X-IOTA-API-Version: 1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"command": "getNodeInfo"}' | jq
    ```

    You should see something like the following in the output:

    ```json
     {
    "appName": "IRI",
    "appVersion": "1.7.0-RELEASE",
    "jreAvailableProcessors": 8,
    "jreFreeMemory": 2115085674,
    "jreVersion": "1.8.0_191",
    "jreMaxMemory": 20997734400,
    "jreTotalMemory": 4860129502,
    "latestMilestone": "CUOENIPTRCNECMVOXSWKOONGZJICAPH9FIG9F9KYXF9VYXFUKTNDCCLLWRZNUHZIGLJZFWPOVCIZA9999",
    "latestMilestoneIndex": 1050373,
    "latestSolidSubtangleMilestone": "CUOENIPTRCNECMVOXSWKOONGZJICAPH9FIG9F9KYXF9VYXFUKTNDCCLLWRZNUHZIGLJZFWPOVCIZA9999",
    "latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex": 1050373,
    "milestoneStartIndex": -1,
    "lastSnapshottedMilestoneIndex": 1039138,
    "neighbors":6,
    "packetsQueueSize":0,
    "time":1548407444641,
    "tips":0,
    "transactionsToRequest":0,
    "features":["snapshotPruning","dnsRefresher","tipSolidification"],
    "coordinatorAddress": "EQSAUZXULTTYZCLNJNTXQTQHOMOFZERHTCGTXOLTVAHKSA9OGAZDEKECURBRIXIJWNPFCQIOVFVVXJVD9",
    "dbSizeInBytes": 144800000,
    "duration": 0
    }
    ```

Now that your node is up and running, it'll start to synchronize its ledger with the network. Give your node some time to synchronize. See [Check that the IOTA node is synchronized](#step-5-check-that-the-node-is-synchronized).

## Step 4. Create a systemd service to control your node

A `systemd` service runs when a Linux system boots up. By using a `systemd` service, you can start, stop, restart, and control logging for IRI with simple one-line commands. You can also make sure that IRI starts automatically when you restart your device.

1. If you're node is running, press **Ctrl**+**C** to stop it

2. Create a new `systemd` file

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/iri.service
    ```

3. Copy and paste the following into the file. Replace `jake` with your Linux username, and replace the `${VERSION}` placeholder with the version of the IRI that you downloaded.

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=IOTA IRI Service
    After=network-online.target
    
    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/home/jake/node
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=60 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=75 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=10000 -XX:+UseG1GC -Xms2G -Xmx4G -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar /home/jake/node/iri-${VERSION}.jar -c /home/jake/node/config.ini
    KillMode=process
    Type=simple
    User=jake
    StandardOutput=inherit
    StandardError=inherit

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

4. Save the file by pressing **Ctrl**+**X**, **y** then **Enter**

5. Give yourself permission to execute the `iri` service and enable it to start at boot

    ```bash
    sudo chmod u+x /etc/systemd/system/iri.service
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable iri
    ```

6. Start IRI and check that it's running

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start iri
    systemctl status iri
    ```

    If IRI is running, you should see the `active (running)` message in the output.

7. Display the log messages

    ```bash
    journalctl -fu iri
    ```

8. To stop displaying the log messages press **Ctrl**+**C**. IRI will continue running in the background

### Stop and restart IRI

You can use the following `systemd` commands to start, stop, and restart IRI:

```bash
# Start
sudo systemctl start iri
# Restart
sudo systemctl restart iri
# Stop
sudo systemctl stop iri
```

### View log messages

You can view the log messages as they are written by doing the following:

```bash
journalctl -fu iri
```

If you want more detailed log messages, you can stop IRI and execute the IRI Java file with the `--debug` flag. Replace `jake` with your Linux username, and replace the `${VERSION}` placeholder with the version of the IRI that you downloaded.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop iri
java -jar /home/jake/node/iri${VERSION}.jar --debug
```

## Step 5. Check that the IOTA node is synchronized

A node is considered synchronized when the `latestMilestoneIndex` field is equal to the `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex` field:

- `latestMilestoneIndex`: Index of the latest milestone that the IOTA node has received from its neighbors. This field is accurate only when the IOTA node is connected to synchronized neighbors.

- `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex`: Index of the latest solid milestone that's in the IOTA node's ledger

1. To check the current `latestMilestoneIndex` field, go to our [Discord](https://discord.iota.org) and enter **!milestone** in the #botbox channel

    ![Entering !milestone on Discord](../images/discord-milestone-check.PNG)

2. To check these fields for your IRI node, call the `getNodeInfo` API endpoint

    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl jq
    curl -s http://localhost:14265 -X POST -H 'X-IOTA-API-Version: 1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"command": "getNodeInfo"}' | jq
    ```

Make sure that the `latestMilestoneIndex` field is equal to the `latestSolidSubtangleMilestoneIndex` field.

If these fields aren't equal, your node is not synchronized. See Troubleshooting for help.

## Troubleshooting

These are known issues that you may find while following this guide and some suggested steps to resolve them.

## The IRI won't synchronize with its neighbors

It may take some time for node to synchronize, so we recommend that you wait a while to see if it synchronizes by itself.

- [Make sure that you have 6 or 7 neighbors](../how-to-guides/find-neighbor-iri-nodes.md)

- Make sure that you're running the [latest version of the IRI](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases)

- Make sure that your node's neighbors are sending data among each other. Call the `getNeighbors` endpoint to see both the incoming transactions (`numberOfAllTransactions`) and the number of outgoing transactions (`numberOfSentTransactions`). If your neighbors aren't sending you data, find new neighbors to connect to.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:14265 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-IOTA-API-Version: 1' -d '{"command": "getNeighbors"}'
    ```

- Ask for more support on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org) either in our #help or #fullnodes channel

## Next steps

[Set up a reverse proxy](../how-to-guides/set-up-a-reverse-proxy.md) for your node so that you can configure HTTPS support, rate limiting, and load balancing.
