# Bee

A framework for building IOTA nodes, clients, and applications in Rust.


## A Rusty IOTA Node ðŸ¦€
The IOTA Foundation aims to allow machines of all performance levels to contribute to the IOTA network, from microcontrollers to phones, web browsers, and servers.

Therefore, Bee is being developed as a modular collection of extendable crates, which expose foreign function interfaces (FFIs) for the next iteration of client libraries.

### Why we choosed Rust?
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. Itâ€™s developed by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org) and backed up with sponsoring by big players. Rust is powerful and loved by it's developers.
